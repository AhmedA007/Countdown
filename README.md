## Introduction

This Python script creates a countdown timer that takes user input for the desired time in seconds and displays a real-time countdown in the format "MM:SS" on the same line. It uses the `time` module for time-related functions and demonstrates various programming concepts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the game script
4. Enter the desired countdown time in seconds when prompted by the script.
5. The countdown timer will display the remaining time in the format "MM:SS" and update in real-time on the same line.
6. Once the countdown reaches zero, the script will print "Boommm!!" to indicate the end of the countdown.

## Code Structure

- The script imports the `time` module for time-related functions.

- It defines a `countdown` function to create and display the countdown.

- Inside the function, it uses a `while` loop for the countdown, string formatting for the timer display, and input processing to get the user's desired countdown time.
